And quickly he's subdued
Through constant pain disgrace

I say more dumb stuff before 9 a.m. than most people say all day.

"You know what’s weird? Donald Duck never wore pants.

he always puts a towel around his waist.

I HAD TO EAT EVERYTHING.
SUP WITH THE WACK PLAYSTATION, SUP
HOW YOU DOIN'?
WHAT WOULD A DINOSAUR DO?

Psychic spies from China
Try to steal your mind's elation
Little girls from Sweden
Dream of silver screen quotations
And if you want these kind of dreams
It's Californication
